## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. First, understand the problem
2. Break it into components
3. Solve each component
4. Verify the solution

Problem: [your problem]
```

### 2. Role-Playing
```
You are an expert [role] with [X years] experience.
Your task is to [specific task].
Approach this with [specific mindset/approach].
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
```
First pass: [initial request]
Second pass: Now make it more [specific quality]
Third pass: Optimize for [different quality]
```

### 4. Multi-Modal Reasoning
```
Analyze this from multiple angles:
1. Technical perspective
2. Business perspective
3. User experience perspective
4. Security perspective

Topic: [your topic]
```

## Use Cases for the Fleet

### 1. Code Generation
```
Generate a Python script that:
- Scans GitHub repos for TODOs
- Creates issues automatically
- Uses the gh CLI

Include error handling and logging.
```

### 2. Documentation
```
Write README documentation for:
- Project: [name]
- Audience: [developers/users]
- Key features: [list]
- Include: installation, usage, examples
```

### 3. Debugging Help
```
I'm getting this error: [paste error]
My code: [paste relevant code]
Expected behavior: [describe]
Actual behavior: [describe]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

### 4. Architecture Design
```
Design a system for:
- Purpose: [what it does]
- Scale: [expected users/load]
- Constraints: [budget, tech, time]

Provide:
- High-level architecture
- Technology recommendations
- Trade-offs considered
```

### 5. Learning New Technologies
```
Create a 30-day learning plan for:
- Technology: [name]
- My background: [current skills]

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### ❌ Too Vague
**Bad:** "Help me with code"
**Good:** "Debug this Python function that's returning None instead of the expected list"

### ❌ Missing Context
**Bad:** "Why isn't this working?"
**Good:** "I'm trying to [goal]. I tried [approach]. Getting [error]. Expected [result]."

### ❌ No Constraints
**Bad:** "Build me a website"
**Good:** "Build a landing page for [product] using [framework] with [specific features]"

### ❌ Single Massive Prompt
**Bad:** 2000-word prompt asking for everything
**Good:** Break into conversational steps
